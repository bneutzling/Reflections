When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- You would want to use a remote repository if you want to work with a group of contributors, if you workon multiple devices
and want an easy way to share your progress between them, or if you want an extra copy of your project online as backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?
- You would want to pull changes manually so you are always aware and prepared for those changes. If Git automatically updated
your repository for you, you may lose track of the changes that were made. Git also automatically updates the head after a 
pull, so if you're currently working on another commit, it may conflict with your current work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When should you use one istead of another?
- Forks clone a repository on GitHub to your GitHub profile, making it easy to make your own personal version of a repository
while still offering credit to the original author. Clones copy a repository to Git without creating a new remote, so you
can work on a repository remotely and add to the original remote. Branches start a new line of commits without updating 
your main files, allowing you to experiment freely.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- It allows you to make changes to the files in the repository without needing to worry about conflicts from merging.
